# Knapsack Problem Using Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)

This project solves the classic **Knapsack Problem** using an **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)**. It demonstrates how to maximize the total value of items that can fit into a knapsack with a given weight capacity while maintaining interactivity through a Streamlit dashboard.

## Problem Statement

Imagine you're planning a trip and need to pack items into a bag with limited capacity. Each item has a specific weight and value. Your goal is to select items that maximize the value of your packed bag without exceeding its weight limit.

## Features

### üõ† Functionalities
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Adjust parameters like weight capacity and population size from the sidebar.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Observe the algorithm evolve over generations to find the optimal solution.
- **Results Table:** Displays the selected items with their weight, value, and total metrics.
- **Data Insights:** View the dataset of available items and experiment with different configurations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters (Set in Sidebar)
1. **Knapsack Capacity:** The maximum weight the bag can carry.
2. **Population Size:** Number of solutions in each generation.
3. **Top Individuals:** Number of top-performing solutions used to learn the probability distribution.
4. **Generations:** Number of iterations for the algorithm to evolve.
5. **Toggle Early Termination:** disable stopping early when the best solution is found.

## How It Works

The **Estimation of Distribution Algorithm (EDA)** works as follows:
1. **Initialization:** Randomly generate solutions (populations of items) within the weight limit.
2. **Fitness Evaluation:** Calculate the total value of items in each solution.
3. **Selection:** Choose the top-performing solutions to learn a probability distribution.
4. **Sampling:** Generate new solutions based on the learned distribution.
5. **Evolution:** Repeat the process for the specified number of generations or until the optimal solution is found.
